# `r emo::ji("fire")` `drake` for Workflow Happiness `r emo::ji("fire")`

This is an intro to the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) R package for data pipelining. It might be useful for you if you're interested in reproducibility after you make changes to your code.

The talk is split into two parts: [**slides**](https://aedobbyn.github.io/nyc-fires/index.html), and a [**live coding walkthrough**](https://github.com/aedobbyn/nyc-fires/blob/master/live_code.md). The latter is meant to be stepped through in an R session rather than knit. 

### Why all the fire emoji tho

...especially if the whole point of `drake` is that you don't need to burn it all down and start from scratch each time?

This talk is motivated by the [**NYCFireWire Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/NYCFireWire) with an assist from [Gritty](https://youtu.be/FNt0anp7WK8?t=8) at a [burner account](https://twitter.com/didntstartit).

It relies on the [**`rtweet`**](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet) and [**`ggmap`**](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) packages, so to be able to run it in full you'll need a [Twitter API access token](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html) and [Google Maps Geocoding API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Geocoding).

### Other things you might want to know

* All functions live in [`didnt_start_it.R`](https://github.com/aedobbyn/nyc-fires/blob/master/R/didnt_start_it.R).

* Feel free to use any and all of the data, including the [raw](https://github.com/aedobbyn/nyc-fires/blob/master/data/raw/lots_o_fires.csv) and [geocoded](https://github.com/aedobbyn/nyc-fires/blob/master/data/derived/dat.csv) tweet motherlode.

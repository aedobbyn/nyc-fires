```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

From `?drake_config`: "Targets are the objects and files that drake generates, and commands are the pieces of R code that produce them."

1. Store prework (loading packages and user-defined functions) in a file
2. Store a `drake` plan in another file
3. Create the plan and run it

Drake will only re-run the parts of the plan that are out of date, and all those parts' dependencies.

A plan works by using functions to create targets. 
Running `drake_plan` creates a dataframe relating each target to the function used to generate it.
